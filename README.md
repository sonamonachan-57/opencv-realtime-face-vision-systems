 # 6. 📌 Real-Time Head Pose Estimation using OpenCV & dlib

## 📖 Overview

This project implements **real-time head pose estimation** using a webcam.
It detects a face, extracts facial landmarks, and estimates the head orientation (pose) using the **solvePnP** algorithm from OpenCV.

The output is visualized as a **line projecting from the nose**, indicating the head direction.



## 🔮 Features

   🔹Real-time webcam head pose estimation
   
   🔹Facial landmark detection using dlib (68-point model)
   
   🔹Pose estimation using OpenCV `solvePnP`

##  Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Facial Landmark Detection

dlib detects 68 facial keypoints.
This project uses:

* Nose tip → 30
* Chin → 8
* Left eye corner → 36
* Right eye corner → 45
* Left mouth → 48
* Right mouth → 54



### 🔹 3D Model Points

Predefined approximate 3D face model used for pose estimation.



### 🔹 solvePnP

Computes:

* Rotation vector → Head orientation
* Translation vector → Face position



### 🔹 projectPoints

# 7. 😴 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## 📌 Overview

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a computer vision–based safety application that monitors a person's eye activity using a webcam to detect signs of drowsiness. When the system detects that the eyes remain closed beyond a defined threshold, it triggers both visual and audio alerts to wake the person.

This system is designed to help reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue by providing real-time monitoring and warning mechanisms.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a real-time system that:

  Detects a human face using computer vision

  Tracks facial landmarks to locate the eyes

  Calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine eye closure

  Triggers alerts when drowsiness is detected

## ⚙️ How It Works:

If EAR < Threshold → Drowsiness Detected
        │
        ▼
Visual Alert + Voice Warning
```

## Process Explanation

🔹The webcam captures real-time video frames.

🔹The system detects faces using dlib’s frontal face detector.

🔹Facial landmarks are extracted using the 68-point landmark predictor.

🔹Eye coordinates are identified from the facial landmarks.

🔹The Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) is calculated using Euclidean distance.

🔹If the EAR falls below the threshold (0.25), the system assumes the eyes are closed.

🔹A visual warning message and voice alert are triggered.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python
    OpenCV – real-time computer vision processing
    dlib – face detection and facial landmark detection
    SciPy – Euclidean distance calculations
    pyttsx3 – text-to-speech alert system

## ✨ Features:

🔹Real-time face detection

🔹Eye tracking using facial landmarks

🔹Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based drowsiness detection

🔹Visual alert messages

🔹Audio warning system

🔹Works with a standard webcam

## 📦 Installation

1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
     
    pip install opencv-python dlib scipy pyttsx3
2️⃣ Download Facial Landmark Model

Download the dlib facial landmark predictor file:

    shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

Place it in the same project directory.

 download it from:

    http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2


   The webcam will start and the system will monitor eye activity in real time.

## 📸 Example Output

    When drowsiness is detected:

    DROWSINESS DETECTED
    Alert!!!! WAKE UP DUDE

An audio warning will also be played using text-to-speech.

⚠️ Threshold Value

The system uses an Eye Aspect Ratio threshold of 0.25.

    EAR < 0.25 → Eyes Closed → Drowsiness Alert

This value can be adjusted depending on user behavior and environment.
